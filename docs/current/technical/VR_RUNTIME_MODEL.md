# Experience VR Runtime Model

Status: canonical description of the implemented runtime synchronized on 2026-08-08. Approved future gameplay is documented in the [gameplay roadmap](../concept/EXPERIENCE_VR_GAMEPLAY_ROADMAP.md).

## Runtime boundary and lifecycle

`src/experienceVr.js` is the composition root of an independent, dynamically imported WebXR runtime. It owns its renderer, scene, base camera, `playerRig`, two controllers and `renderer.setAnimationLoop`; it does not start Experience 3D. Runtime preparation precedes the direct **Enter VR** gesture. The requested reference space is `local-floor`, with `local` fallback.

The composition root owns the small `VrAudioBridge` lifecycle. Optional VR audio requests cross its fail-soft boundary, which contains both synchronous exceptions and Promise rejections and reports them as `[vr-audio]` warnings. Calls are fire-and-forget side effects after gameplay transitions; they are never awaited by session, input, progression, state-machine or render-frame flows. The bridge delegates Web Audio ownership to the shared `audioManager`, stores no gameplay state and is disposed idempotently on `pagehide`. Five unity-gain VR buses (`SPACE`, `AMBIENT`, `DEVICE`, `WORLD`, `UI`) now feed the existing Master Volume/mute. The UI and world/device one-shot packages and glyph acquisition lifecycle remain active. The Astro Attractor shell pull now drives one seamless `noise_laud_loop_02.mp3` DEVICE source: immediate start, same-target one-second recovery with playhead preservation and roughly 0.1-second gain restoration, deliberate-cancel fade, and a 0.5-second fade after successful ordinary-ray handoff. A different shell identity starts a new lifecycle. Other planned Attractor target classes, ambient sequencing, Asterion Sphere audio, and spatial audio remain **not implemented**.

Every session aligns the rig so the tracked head reaches the configured start `(0, 0, 5.8)`. WebXR owns the tracked camera; locomotion and alignment transform `playerRig`, and the rig is now a passenger of the platform root rather than a world-stable camera island. Session exit/re-entry clears transient crystals, shell interaction, controller hits, halos, glyph state, reliquary/buttons, Asterion QA state and portal preview, while committed progress and floor projection survive in the already prepared page runtime. Reload/navigation recreates them. There is no durable save or full-game reset.

Controller records may be constructed with `handedness === ''`. Hand identity is resolved only at runtime after WebXR's `connected` event; semantic input and hand-mode lookup therefore do not assume handedness during construction.

## World and platform hierarchy

The active hierarchy is platform-relative for floor gameplay and world-stable for the distant frame:

```text
WORLD
├── world-stable glyphRing / shell field / cosmos
└── VrTiltableFloorRoot
    ├── floor sectors / rings
    ├── monkeyAnchor
    ├── VrPlatformFixturesRoot
    │   ├── portal
    │   ├── reliquary
    │   ├── furnace
    │   └── furnace panel
    └── VrFloorPassengerRoot
        └── playerRig
            └── camera / controllers / grips
```

`VrTiltableFloorRoot` is both the visual progress floor root and the active platform transform root. Platform fixtures, the monkey anchor and `VrFloorPassengerRoot/playerRig` inherit the platform quaternion. The glyph ring, shell field and cosmic/distant frame stay under the world-stable root so platform rotation changes the player's local platform relationship without rotating the target field itself.

## Ordinary rays, hand modes and locomotion

Both ordinary white controller rays have a maximum range of `2.3 m`. Interactive glyph, crystal, button and shell hits report their distance each frame, and the visible ray shortens to the nearest real hit. There is no scene-global raycast. Trigger state does not extend the ordinary range.

Hand modes are independent per hand:

```text
LEFT:  X → NORMAL_HAND ↔ ASTERION_SPHERE
RIGHT: A / existing toggle → NORMAL_HAND ↔ ASTRO_ATTRACTOR
```

`createVrHandModeController` owns equip/unequip for both tools. In right `NORMAL_HAND`, the Astro Attractor model is hidden and the connected right ordinary ray is active. In right `ASTRO_ATTRACTOR`, Astro is visible and the right ordinary ray is hidden. In left `ASTERION_SPHERE`, the Asterion Sphere is equipped and the left ordinary ray is hidden; in left `NORMAL_HAND`, the sphere is unequipped and the left ordinary ray returns immediately. The two modes do not block each other, so Asterion Sphere and Astro Attractor can be equipped at the same time.

The left joystick continuously yaws `playerRig`. The right joystick translates it on the current platform-local tangent plane: the platform normal replaces world Y, movement is resolved from the viewer direction projected onto that local plane, diagonal input is capped, and the rig's local Y is preserved. The walking boundary is the snapshot `glyphOrbit.effectiveRadius` captured for the platform passenger root; at the radial boundary, the outward component is blocked while tangent motion remains allowed. Teleport, jump, snap turn and horizon-lock camera compensation are absent: the camera/controllers/grips inherit `VrTiltableFloorRoot` through `VrFloorPassengerRoot`.

## Glyphs, crystals and reliquary

Each controller raycasts the real visible glyph meshes. A `0.5 s` hold spawns the next unrepresented branch tier; a miss pauses progress for `0.15 s`, then cancels it. The crystal position is the glyph's captured world position offset `0.30 m` toward the central object. Acquisition is additive and not gated by the current global tier.

The five branches contain `3 / 3 / 3 / 4 / 5` cards. Fifteen preloaded GLBs provide three cyclic crystal variants per branch. A physical crystal carries branch/glyph identity, tier, visual variant and transient interaction state, but no persistent card/page identity. Available crystals use the ordinary `2.3 m` ray and squeeze-grab.

`VrProgressionController` exclusively owns committed portfolio-card progression, branch/tier completion and the source projected by the floor. Tiers 1–3 require all five branches, tier 4 Metal + Water, and tier 5 Water. Held-crystal proximity to the authored insertion sphere gives green valid or red invalid feedback. Invalid release enters `rejecting` and returns the crystal to `available`. Activate resolves and previews the branch+tier page without progress. Release after Activate commits it, activates its floor panel, tests tier completion and consumes the crystal over `0.55 s`; Release without Activate returns it without progress. Furnace material progression is a separate domain owned by `VrAstroFurnaceProgressionController`; there is no central global progression store.

The progress floor has five authored sectors, 18 panels and five optional procedural full-circle tier rings. A completed tier pulses its idempotent ring and leaves a subtle glow. Failure limited to procedural ring creation does not block the sector/panel floor.

## Tier 1, Astro and shell field

Tier 1 completion both unlocks Astro and activates the shell field. The field contains **18 shells: six cached `shell-relic-*` assets cloned three times each**. Their deterministic orbits occupy radii `[R, 2R]`, where `R` is the effective glyph-ring radius. `?p1` remains a one-shot QA shortcut that commits the five tier-1 pages, mirrors them to the floor and synchronizes this post-tier-1 world state.

Semantic input maps standard-gamepad button `4` to edge-triggered `toggleRightTool` on the right hand and `toggleLeftTool` on the left hand, button `1` to analog `grabAction` (squeeze) and button `0` to analog `primaryAction` (trigger). After Tier 1, right A toggles `NORMAL_HAND ↔ ASTRO_ATTRACTOR`; before unlock it cannot equip Astro. When `?asterionSphere` enables QA equipment, left X toggles `NORMAL_HAND ↔ ASTERION_SPHERE`.

### Scan and targeting

With Astro equipped, right squeeze/grab above `0.1` shows one `VrAttractorScanCone` on controller-local `-Z`. Its length is `3R`, half-angle `2.5°`, current color `0x78ff9c`, opacity pulse `0.035–0.065`, and pulse period `1.6 s`.

Shell selection is an analytic cone-volume test against cached per-shell bounding spheres. It is not a fan of raycasts. The nearest valid angular/depth candidate receives `VrTargetHalo`. A real shell hit has priority over crystal grab; no shell hit means no shell-over-crystal priority.

### Pull and capture contract

While scan remains active, right trigger above `0.1` starts and sustains pull. Acceleration is `10 m/s²`, speed is capped at `8.5 m/s`, and capture readiness begins within `0.28 m` of the capture point. The point is recalculated as:

```text
worldPosition(PIVOT_RING_MASTER)
+ worldDirection(controller local -Z) * 1.3 m
```

The public sequence is `orbiting → targeted → pulling → capture_ready → held → placed`; `returning` is an internal recovery state. Cancelling scan or trigger before left-hand takeover sends the shell through a `0.8 s` smooth return to its continuously advancing orbit. During return `attractorTarget=false`; after completion state is `orbiting` and `attractorTarget=true`.

### Handoff, placement and re-grab

A `capture_ready` shell is not acquired by hand proximity. It must be hit by the left ordinary ray while the left hand is in `NORMAL_HAND` (maximum `2.3 m`): ray hit → `VrTargetHalo` → `reportRayHit` → left squeeze → `held`. Left release reparents it under `VrWorldRoot` as `placed`.

A placed shell retains `attractorTarget=false`, so Astro cannot acquire it again. It can, however, be repeatedly targeted, haloed and squeeze-grabbed with the ordinary `2.3 m` ray of either free hand; the right hand can do so only in `NORMAL_HAND`, and the left hand can do so only in `NORMAL_HAND`. Releasing it returns it to `placed`.

## Astro Furnace and Asterion material progression

The Astro Furnace is a separate subsystem backed by `public/glb/astral_stove.glb`, preloaded through `AssetManager`, placed opposite the portal under `VrPlatformFixturesRoot`, grounded from visible bounds, scaled to `3` and faced toward the configured start. Authored open/close animation remains unchanged. During a material cycle the authored process pivot drives the chamber and a base-pose-relative runtime offset drives the lid, with smooth acceleration and deceleration rather than transform snapping.

The furnace is deliberately unconfigured at session start: Option owns `activeMode = null`. Open, insertion and Activate are unavailable until the player opens the panel with Option and selects **Asterion Sphere**, which activates `floor_gyroscope_sphere`. Option is therefore the first suggested step. Selection rotates `PIVOT_BUTTON_OPTION` by `+90°` around its local Y axis relative to its authored base quaternion.

Exactly one each of `shell-relic-1` through `shell-relic-6` is required. `VrAstroFurnaceProgressionController` owns these six identity-based binary material slots independently from portfolio progression. Commit remains strictly gated by the conjunction `CONSUMED + COMPLETE`; interruption before it clears transient content without progress. At `6/6` the material owner remains unchanged, while the separate production controller opens `READY`. The **IMPLEMENTED** `UTWÓRZ` ray region starts one approximately five-second scale/rotation materialization of the existing Asterion model at authored `VR_FURNACE_ESSENCE_ANCHOR`; completion alone commits `AVAILABLE`. The world sphere follows the furnace/platform and is explicitly claimed only by left `NORMAL_HAND` ordinary ray + halo + squeeze. Claim commits page-runtime `EARNED`, auto-equips through `createVrHandModeController`, and thereafter X toggles the QA-proven gyro equipment without a query flag. Session reset cancels `BUILDING` to `READY`, preserves/recreates `AVAILABLE`, and preserves `EARNED`; reload adds no persistence.

The single-shell cycle is **IMPLEMENTED**: a valid missing shell is locked at `VR_FURNACE_CONTENT_ANCHOR`, then accepted Activate runs one normalized 18-second clock at 42 RPM. EXTRACTION occupies `6–15 s` and cooldown `15–18 s`. The same progress drives chamber/lid motion, `fire_cell`, shell emission/fade and four cheap emissive meshes under `VR_FURNACE_LIGHT_ORBIT`; only one optional shadowless process light exists. `/audio/astro_piec_work_01.mp3` starts once on the DEVICE bus after an accepted start and is lifecycle-cleaned without blocking gameplay. Completion consumes the raw shell and commits exactly once; reopening permits the next missing type. Reset/dispose cancels effects and audio and never commits.

## Production Asterion Sphere and QA override

`?asterionSphere` remains an independent QA availability override for the same physical Asterion Sphere / Kula Asterionowa. Production availability instead comes from `EARNED`. It does not commit shells, does not alter `VrAstroFurnaceProgressionController`, does not fake `6/6`, and does not reinterpret the furnace panel preview as a production physical object. The runtime loads `public/glb/asterion_sphere.glb` through `AssetManager`; the hand-mode controller equips the cloned model on the resolved left `grip` only in left `ASTERION_SPHERE` and unequips it in left `NORMAL_HAND`.

The gyro contract separates three orientations:

- **PREVIEW** — live hand orientation expressed through `CONTROL BASE + HAND REFERENCE`. It drives `inner_ring2`, `inner_ring3` and `PIV_TARGET_AXIS`; authored idle fan motion on `inner_ring2/inner_ring3` remains active. While the trigger is held, ring visualization is stabilized so the preview remains readable.
- **COMMAND** — the drive target accepted from PREVIEW while the left trigger is held. Releasing the trigger freezes COMMAND; release does not stop the platform.
- **CURRENT** — the actual orientation of `VrTiltableFloorRoot`. It drives `master_ring1`, `master_ring2` and `inner_ring1`.

After LOCK, the interaction rebases CONTROL BASE / HAND REFERENCE from CURRENT so repeated target steps do not accumulate a visual offset. `displayPreviewQuaternion` provides an approximately `0.5 s` visual rebase, so the TARGET-frame does not visually teleport when the local reference is recaptured.

Left tool lifecycle is explicit. The gyro never auto-equips the sphere. Unequip freezes COMMAND but the heavy CURRENT drive continues toward it. Left-hand movement and trigger input do not control the gyro while the left hand is in `NORMAL_HAND`. Re-equip performs a no-jump capture from the current CURRENT orientation, and the ordinary left ray is available immediately after unequip.

### Heavy angular drive

The current platform drive is a heavy angular controller, not a rigid-body simulation and not the old exponential/capped slerp runtime path. It maintains `angularVelocity` and steers it with these active tuning values:

```text
maxAngularSpeedDegrees      = 32
angularAccelerationDegrees  = 32
angularDecelerationDegrees  = 45
settleAngularSpeedDegrees   = 0.15
```

The controller uses braking distance to choose speed toward COMMAND, caps angular speed, supports smooth retargeting without zeroing velocity, and preserves motion after trigger release. LOCK requires both small angular error and small angular speed; only then does the final exact settle write CURRENT to COMMAND and zero velocity.
